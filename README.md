the number 4 has four letters.
every number, if you take the amount of letters it has, and the amount of letters in that word, and so on
you will eventually hit four. 

This program counts how many times you must count the letters in a word until you hit four, which is dubbed the perfect number.

~~I know perfect numbers are a thing in math fight me about it~~
